# The Windalco residual lake in Manchester, Jamaica.


## Abstract

Red mud waste is a residual product from the processing of bauxite to extract
aluminum. This waste product is an iron rich clay that is also laden with rare earth
element (REE) materials. The use of red mud clay is not limited to rare earths but has
also been proposed for building material such as bricks and cement mix. Industrial
materials undergo a series of stress and strain testing and standard proctor tests to
determine the integrity of the building material mix. However, estimating the available
volume of material for procurement is necessary for economic pursuits. As the bauxite
mining industry in Jamaica produces more red mud waste, the available building
material increases. Therefore, it is useful to estimate the total volume of red mud clay
for industrial development. In this study, we use remote sensing techniques to quantify
the volume of material in the Windalco residual lake in Manchester, Jamaica. We
observe the residual pit using advanced measurements from satellite instruments to
improve land surveying and investment protection.
